## Coding Agent Todo List

### Phase 1: Quick Start Foundation (MVP)
- [x] Set up Node.js/TypeScript project structure
- [x] Install core dependencies (commander, inquirer, chalk, openai)
- [x] Create basic CLI entry point with `coding-agent` command
- [x] Add configuration management for API keys
- [x] Set up OpenAI API integration with streaming

### Phase 2: Essential Tools (Quick Start Goals) âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Research how tools work in coding AI agents
- [x] Implement core read-only tools:
  - [x] `Read` - file content reading (Next priority)
  - [x] `LS` - directory listing with metadata, filtering, and security
  - [x] `Glob` - pattern matching (Next priority)
- [x] Add basic project context gathering (file tree via LS tool)
- [x] Create simple conversation memory management
- [x] Implement basic `coding-agent "help me understand this file"` command

### Phase 3: Interactive Chat âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Implement interactive chat interface using inquirer
- [x] Add simple session management for conversation history
- [x] Build simple chat mode with context awareness
- [x] Add basic error handling and graceful degradation

### Phase 4: Advanced Tools (Current Phase)
- [x] ~~**NEXT PRIORITY**: Add Read tool for file content reading~~ âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Add Glob tool for pattern matching
- [ ] Add remaining read-only tool:
  - [ ] `Grep` - content searching
- [ ] Implement modification tools:
  - [ ] `Write` - file creation/overwrite
  - [ ] `Edit` - targeted file editing
  - [ ] `Bash` - shell command execution
- [ ] Add permission system for destructive operations

### Phase 5: Intelligence & Polish
- [ ] Implement intent recognition for coding tasks
- [ ] Build tool selection and orchestration logic
- [ ] Add advanced project context gathering (git state)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add output formatting and terminal styling
- [ ] Write documentation and usage examples

### Quick Start Goals (Target for Phase 2 completion) âœ… ACHIEVED
- [x] Basic `coding-agent "help me understand this file"` command
- [x] Simple chat mode with context awareness
- [x] File reading and basic code analysis capabilities (via LS tool integration)

## Recent Achievements (Interactive Chat Implementation)

### âœ… What We Just Completed:
- **Interactive Chat with Inquirer**: Full implementation with natural language input
- **Chat Commands**: Help system, graceful exit (exit/quit/q), Ctrl+C handling
- **AI Integration**: Seamless integration with ToolOrchestrator and LLMService
- **User Experience**: Welcome messages, real-time feedback, error handling
- **Tool Integration**: LS tool available in both direct commands and chat mode

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Status:
- MVP goals achieved - agent can have conversations and list directories
- Interactive chat mode fully functional
- Tool system established with LS, Glob, and Read tools
- All 3 quick start goals are now complete

### ðŸš€ Next Priorities:
1. **Grep Tool** - Content searching for code analysis
2. **Enhanced Context** - Better project understanding capabilities
3. **Write Tool** - File creation/modification for advanced functionality

This reorganization prioritizes getting a working prototype with the three quick start goals before adding advanced features. Each phase builds logically on the previous one.
